# Subject: Text-based histogram
## Description:
Generate a text-based histogram for a quiz given to a class of students. The quiz is graded on a scale from 0 to 5. Write a program that allows the user to enter grades from a file “grade.txt” for each student. As the grades are being entered, the program should count, using an array, the number of 0’s, the number of 1’s, the number of 2’s, the number of 3’s, the number of 4’s, and the number of 5’s. The program should be capable of handling an arbitrary number of student grades.Output the histogram count at the end. 

## Input:
if the input grades are 3 0 1 3 3 5 5 4 5 4 


## Output:
the program should output
1 grade(s) of 0
1 grade(s) of 1
0 grade(s) of 2
3 grade(s) of 3
2 grade(s) of 4
3 grade(s) of 5
