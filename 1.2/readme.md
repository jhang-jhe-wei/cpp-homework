# Subject: Input_Output3
## Description:
Given an arbitrary integer INPUT ( INPUT ), follow the requirements below to 
output it:


If the number of characters in INPUT (including the negative sign) is less 
than 10 digits, fill in the space at the beginning, so that the number of 
spaces plus the number of characters in INPUT just meets 10 digits.

- The decimal (excluding the decimal point) must occupy N characters in the output and the decimal number N digits must be unconditionally discarded. If the decimal part of X is less than N digits, please make up 0.
- If the corrected number of X characters (including negative and decimal points) is less than M words, please fill in the input character C at the beginning of the number, so that the number of characters C plus the number itself contains exactly the number of characters. Meet the M digits.




## Input:
Each line represents an INPUT, the program continues to request input, and ends if EOF is read.


## Output:

Each line is output according to the requirements of the problem.
