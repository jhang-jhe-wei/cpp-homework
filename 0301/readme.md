# Subject:  Occurrenc Counting
## Description:
Write a program that reads in an array of type int from a file, the file named
“intArray.txt”. Please note that the number of entries is not limited. Your 
program determines how many entries are used. The output is to be a two-column 
list. The first column is a list of the distinct array elements; the second 
column is the count of the number of occurrences of each element. The list 
should be sorted on entries in the first column, largest to smallest.

## Input:
For the array values: –12 3 –12 4 1 1 –12 1 –1 1 2 3 4 2 3 –12


## Output:
N Count
4 2
3 3
2 2
1 4
–1 1
–12 4
The two integers are divided by one tab(\t).
