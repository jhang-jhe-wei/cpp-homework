# Subject: Design Month Class
## Description:
Define a class called Month that is an abstract data type for a month. Your class will have one member variable of type int to represent a month (1 for January, 2 for February, and so forth). 
Include all the following member functions: 
1. a constructor to set the month using the first three letters in the name of the month as three arguments, a constructor to set the month using an integer as an argument (1 for January, 2 for February, and so forth), a default constructor.
2. an input function name inputInt that reads the month as an integer.
3. an input function name inputStr that reads the month as the first three letters in the name of the month.
4. an output function name outputInt that output the month as an integer.
5. an output function name outputStr that outputs the month as the first three letters in the name of the month.
6. a member function name nextMonth that returns the next month as a value of type Month. Embed your class definition in a test program.

Note that if month out of range, set the month to January.


## Input:
Replace the main from main.cpp and enter the test data in input.txt.

## Output:
See the Sample Output.

- [x]  Eazy,Only basic programming syntax and structure are required.
- [ ]  Medium,Multiple programming grammars and structures are required.
- [ ] Hard,Need to use multiple program structures or complex data types.
